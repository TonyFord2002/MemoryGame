A memory game for 2. 

This is a game played between two people. Player 1 starts by flipping over two cards and see if they match. If they do then player one gets a point. If they don't then the cards get flipped back over and the second player gets to flip two cards over and see if they match. I wrote this game for my fiancé's 1st grade class using their sight words they are learning. I wanted to be able to show them that something can be made to suit their individual needs and can be fun to play at the same time. 

I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to write this program. I have an instructions button that can be pushed to be allowed to read how to play the game and a start new game button to reset the board and player names. I declared all of my card places in my HTML and moved them into position with CSS. In my JavaScript file I created all of the cards and got them into a random position. Then I made them all clickable and an image for the face side. After that there are functions to compare the two cards selected to check if they are a match, if not they get flipped back over and it’s the other player’s turn. There is also a function to check if all the cards have been matched then declare a winner. 

I have to give credit to the many heads and eyes that helped me to complete this project. If not for them many more hours of sleep would have been lost.
